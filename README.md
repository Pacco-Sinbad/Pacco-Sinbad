  My main project right now is learning the Godot Engine and gdScript. While I do that I'm actively working on a web based RPG project driven by text
  and decision making. It's kind of a throw back to the RPG's of the past but I plan to give it a little extra here and there. That project can be found
  above and I would appreciate any feed back or suggestions.

  My name is Mathias Fischer.
  
  I am a married father of two wonderful children.
  
  I've spent the last few years learning more about the tech industry and how to program. I've always been fascinated with computers, going so 
  far as to have built a few of them. The next logical step for me was to learn how to tell them what I wanted them to do. 
  
  My background is as a machinist and I spent nine years on the factory floor as a setup operator. Before that I studied course work for material science at 
  Michigan Technological University. I think it was here, working with some of the engineering applications, that I discovered my passion for programming.
  
  I'm currently learning how to use the Godot engine and write gdScript. Making games has never been so accessible and 
  it's a fun way to keep the mind actively problem solving outside of running through problems on codewars.
  
  My other interests include gardening, cycling, 
  pixel art, and fantasy sports.

  My buddy once said something to me about myself that, until he said it, I had never really thought about. He told me, "What ever you do, it seems like you go 100%. 
  You either go into it and learn every little thing about it or you don't waste your time on it at all." And you know what, sometimes to a detriment, he is correct. 
  Programming and writting code have fortunately provided a bottomless well for me to explore.
